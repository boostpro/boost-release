<p>The build layer has just four main parts -- abstract targets,
      virtual targets, generators and properties. The abstract targets,
      represented by the "abstract-target" class, correspond to main targets
      -- which, as you recall, can produce different files depending on
      properties. Virtual targets, represented by the 'virtual-target' class
      correspond to real files. The abstract-target class has a method
      'generate', which is given a set of properties and produces virtual
      targets for those properties.       
    </p>
<p>There are several classes derived from "abstract-target". The
      "main-target" class represents top-level main target, the "project-target"
      acts like container for all main targets, and "basic-target" class is a
      base class for all further target types.
    </p>
<p>Since each main target can have several alternatives, all top-level
      target objects are just containers, referring to "real" main target
      classes. The type is that container is "main-target". For example, given:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
alias a ;
lib a : a.cpp : &lt;toolset&gt;gcc ;
</pre>
<p>
      we would have one-top level instance of "main-target-class", which will
      contain one instance of "alias-target-class" and one instance of
      "lib-target-class". The "generate" method of "main-target" decides
      which of the alternative should be used, and call "generate" on the
      corresponding instance.
</p>
<p>Each alternative is a instance of a class derived from
    "basic-target". The "basic-target.generate" does several things that are
    always should be done:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Determines what properties should be used for building the
          target. This includes looking at requested properties, requirements,
          and usage requirements of all sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Builds all sources</p></li>
<li><p>Computes the usage requirements which should be passes back.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      For the real work of constructing virtual target, a new method
      "construct" is called.
    </p>
<p>The "construct" method can be implemented in any way by classes
      derived from "basic-target", but one specific derived class plays the
      central role -- "typed-target". That class holds the desired type of file
      to be produces, and calls the generators modules to do the job.
    </p>
<p>Generators are Boost.Build abstractions for a tool. For example, one
      can register a generator which converts target of type CPP into target of
      type OBJ. When run with on a virtual target with CPP type, the generator
      will construct the virtual target of type OBJ. The "generators" module
      implements an algorithm, which given a list of sources, the desired type
      and a list of properties, find all the generators which can perform the conversion.
    </p>
<p>The virtual targets which are produces by the main targets form a
      graph. Targets which are produces from other ones refer to an instance of
      "action" class, which in turn refers to action's sources, which can
      further refer to actions. The sources, which are not produces from
      anything, don't refer to any actions.
    </p>
<p>When all virtual targets are produced, they are "actualized". This
    means that the real file names are computed, and the commands that should
    be run are generated. This is done by "virtual-target.actualize" and
    "action.actualize" methods. The first is conceptually simple, while the
    second need additional explanation. The commands in bjam are generated in
    two-stage process. First, a rule with the appropriate name (for example
    "gcc.compile") is called and is given the names of targets. The rule sets
    some variables, like "OPTIONS". After that, the command string is taken,
    and variable are substitutes, so use of OPTIONS inside the command string
    become the real compile options. 
    </p>
<p>Boost.Build added a third stage to simplify things. It's now
    possible to automatically convert properties to appropriate assignments to
    variables. For example, &lt;debug-symbols&gt;on would add "-g" to the
    OPTIONS variable, without requiring to manually add this logic to
    gcc.compile. This functionality is part of the "toolset" module.
    </p>
<p>When target paths are computed and the commands are set, Boost.Build
    just gives control to bjam, which controls the execution of
    commands.</p>
